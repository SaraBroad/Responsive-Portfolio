                  <p>With a thirst for knowledge and the drive for continuous personal and professional growth, I am
                        ready to bring my diverse work and life experiences to your organization. Over the last decade, I
                        have worked in a number of industries, which has provided me with the opportunity to learn a variety of professional skills that are applicable to the web development word. My ability 
                        to problem solve, dedication to being a team player, and creativity are just a few of the skills that I can contribute
                        as an employee.  </p>
                
                        <p>My interest in web development arose during my current position as a technology teacher in the School
                        District of Philadelphia. In my free time, I enjoy exploring Philadelphia with friends and family. I am 
                        reader of fiction and The New Yorker Magazine. I have a passion for traveling and have been known to drive several
                        hours to explore natural landscapes. I onced hiked the Inca trail in Peru for four days in the pouring rain.
